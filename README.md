# HPCDL [RS 2025]
 This is the  Matlab implementation of  paper "Large-scale Hyperspectral Image Projected Clustering via Doubly-stochastic Graph Learning", which is accepted by [Remote Sensing] in 2025. If you are interested at this work, you can star the repository for newest update. Thanks!

# For more works
My studies focus on machine learning (deep learning) and its applications to image enhancement, data clustering (classification), object recognition (tracking) etc.  If you are interested at my works, you can get more papers and codes at my [Homepage](https://nianwang-hjjgcdx.github.io/).

# Usage
First, you should download Longkou dataset at the [Link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1j60wv6lgQbB0WMoUaBeJTw?pwd=1234) and put it in "dataset" path, extract code: 1234. 
Then run "demo.m", the results will be  obtained. We  simultaneously provide the accuracy of each landcover as well as some overall evaluation metrics like OA, NMI etc.
# Acknowledge
